# Phone Catalogue - Store Nice Gadgetsüëå

This project demonstrates a mobile application website, but it also includes real tablets and accessories (watches). The site has a short description of each device, and when you go to this device, you can read a more detailed description. The user can like the product, which is added to the page with favorite products, and can also add products to the cart, where in the future you can increase the number of products and pay.
The website is designed in two colors(white and dark blue), so that the user can choose which color will be pleasant to him.
There will also be a loader on the page that makes waiting for data from the server better.
I wish you a good viewingü´∂
